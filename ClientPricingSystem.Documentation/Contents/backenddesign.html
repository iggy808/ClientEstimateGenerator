                <h2>Design Principles</h2>

                <h3>Testable Code</h3>

                <p>Separation of code is at the core of the backend design, allowing for ease
                in the process of testing, and the creation of accurate and meaningful tests. FluentValidation
                and MediatR are two packages that aid in the separation and testability of code, allowing
                for widespread test coverage that gives accurate insights into the system's current state.
                It is important to ensure that all tests generate valuable insight into the system, and
                accurately test every unit of code both positively and negatively.
                </p>

                <h3>Separation of Documents and Dtos</h3>

                <p>The codebase is designed to handle two forms of data: Document, and Data Transfer Object (DTO).
                Documents are objects that map directly to the objects retrieved from the database, and DTOs are objects
                that map to fields needed for the project's views. This separation is in an effort to keep logic that 
                interacts with database objects separate from controller methods, allowing for the convenient testing of these
                crucial, Document-oriented methods.
                </p>

                <h2>Design In Practice</h2>

                <h3>Controllers</h3>
                
                <p>Because controllers are difficult to test in .NET, we use controllers strictly to route requests
                from the frontend to the desired piece of functionality on the backend. We make use of the MediatR package 
                to succinctly route user requests, minimizing the amount of computation done within controller code.  
                When developing, avoid using Documents within controller methods. Any method that utilizes a database Document
                should be placed in a MediatR method for testing. 
                </p>

                <h3>FluentValidation / MediatR Pipeline</h3>

                <p>The project is configured to handle any MediatR requests in a two-step process, the first being
                the validation of the incoming request. FluentValidation is a package that allows for the structured validation
                of data from incoming requests, ensuring the incoming data from a MediatR request is appropriate.
                Secondly, the request is passed off to the MediatR method for processing.
                </p>

                <h3>Mappers</h3>

                <p>To aid in the readability of the codebase and minimize room for developer error, mappers are used to
                map objects from the database to data transfer objects, and vice versa. Mapperly is the package used in 
                this project to map objects of one type to another. Mapperly's advantage is that all reflection necessary
                to map the objects is done at compile time, thus minimizing the amount of computation necessary to map objects.
                Additionally, Mapperly allows for static mappers, which are employed within this codebase. Static mappers allow
                for the avoidance of using dependency injection for mappers, thus making the code more readable and easy to work with.
                </p>

                <h3>Creating Meaningful Tests</h3>
                <p>When testing, ensure that your test does not use Moq or Moq callbacks in any way that avoids
                testing any feature of the method under test. If a Moq callback is necessary in the test, ensure that the method
                you are setting up the callback for has already been tested elsewhere. If the method has not been tested elsewhere,
                create an issue for testing the untested method.
